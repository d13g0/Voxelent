## Voxelent is now NucleoJS

I won't be updating this project as 'voxelent' any longer. The  library has been updated with more functionality and bug fixes
and can be found under here [NucleoJS] (https://github.com/d13g0/nucleo.js)

During 2016 I will update voxelent's documentation, but the syntax is almost identical if you take a look at the code. Also, I will migrate voxelent.com to the new nucleojs website.

If you have any doubts or questions, feel free to drop me a line

Diego
