VERSION 0.85 - Diego's Birthday
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ambient Lights were removed from vxlView and vxl.api
This is an attribute that is dependent from the selected GLSL program and it should not be here.

2. The method vxlActor.clone was created. YAY!

3. The auxiliary Scene objects (vxlAxis, vxlBoundingBox, vxlFloor) were removed from the
actor list inside vxlScene so they do not interfere with actor counting and actor operations

4. The auxiliary Scene objects were encapsulated in a new class: vxlSceneToys

5. The vxlActor.setColor method was removed. Again, this is GLSL program dependent.
The more generic approach vxlActor.setProperty was created instead

6. The method vxlScene.setColor was removed with no replacement

7.vxlProgram was updated. The syntax to enable/disable attributes and to refer to attribute
pointers is simpler. Also the methods to register/load/use programs were updated.

8. vxl.api was updated. The name of methods that referred to Current Objects (vxl.c) was updated. 
For instance, instead of having vxl.api.getActiveCamera, now we have vxl.api.getCurrentCamera.
This improves consistency in the ontology of the API.

9. The documentation of the namespaces vxl, vxl.go, vxl.c, vxl.def and vxl.api was improved

10. Actors can now be translated and scaled

12. The code for vxlCamera was updated. The commented code that was not being used was removed

13. The folder structure of the library was updated to include: API docs, tutorials, and minified versions.

14. Actors can have different rendering programs
